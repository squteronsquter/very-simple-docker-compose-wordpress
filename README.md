#Even Simple WordPress Docker installation

This is where I keekp this project. Your destination might be different.

Folder named **es** will then become my domain. See below how I open that domain in browser.

I also use Valet to be able to call TLD .test.

But this is just a personal preference.

`mkdir ~/Sites/test_projects/docker_projects/wordpressdocker/es`

`touch README.md`

`touch docker-compose.yml`

Insert the contents of the docker-compose.yml file from this repo and save.

`docker-compose up -d`

Open browser:

http://es/test:8787

or

http://localhost:8787

**Happy coding**
